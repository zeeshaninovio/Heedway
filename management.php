                    <p>Everything DiSC® Management offers a customizable development solution proven to increase the
                        effectiveness of anyone in a management role–whether managing direct reports or the relationship
                        with their own manager. A complete program of classroom training, and online pre-work and
                        follow-up focuses learning in five key areas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding DiSC® styles.</li>
                        <li>Directing and delegating..</li>
                        <li>Creating a motivating environment.</li>
                        <li>Developing others with different styles.</li>
                        <li>Identifying strategies for working more effectively with managers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Participants learn how their management style influences how they manage time, make decisions,
                        approach problems, and what they need to do to adapt to the styles of others to bring out the
                        best in each and every employee in their charge.
